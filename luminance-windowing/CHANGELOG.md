## Major changes

  - Move `swap_buffers` from `GraphicsContext` to `Surface` in [luminance-windowing].

## Minor changes

  - The `WindowOpt` now has support for multisampling. See the `WindowOpt::set_num_samples` for
    further details.
  - Migrate to Rust Edition 2018.
  - Implement dynamic edition of windowing types properties. That allows to change data on-the-fly,
    such as the cursor mode.

## Patch & misc changes

  - Add more CI testing.
  - Massive documentation rewrite (among the use of `#![deny(missing_docs)]`. The situation is still
    not perfect and patch versions will be released to fix and update the documentation. Step by
    step.
  - Massive dependencies update. Special thanks to @eijebong for his help!
