# Changelog

This document is the changelog of [luminance-windowing](https://crates.io/crates/luminance-windowing).
You should consult it when upgrading to a new version, as it contains precious information on
breaking changes, minor additions and patch notes.

**If you’re experiencing weird type errors when upgrading to a new version**, it might be due to
how `cargo` resolve dependencies. `cargo update` is not enough, because all luminance crate use
[SemVer ranges](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html) to stay
compatible with as many crates as possible. In that case, you want `cargo update --aggressive`.

# 0.7

> Fri Sep 20th 2019

# 0.6

# 0.5.1

- Support of `luminance-0.35`.

# 0.5

> Wed Sep 11th 2019

## Major changes

- The `Surface` trait has a new method to implement: `Surface::back_buffer`. That method provides
  the `Framebuffer::back_buffer` in a much more convenient way and is automatically implemented
  by default.

# 0.3.1

> Tue Sep 3rd 2019

- Support of `luminance-0.32`.

# 0.3

> Fri Aug 23th 2019

## Major changes

- Move `swap_buffers` from `GraphicsContext` to `Surface` in [luminance-windowing].

## Minor changes

- The `WindowOpt` now has support for multisampling. See the `WindowOpt::set_num_samples` for
  further details.
- Migrate to Rust Edition 2018.
- Implement dynamic edition of windowing types properties. That allows to change data on-the-fly,
  such as the cursor mode.

## Patch & misc changes

- Add more CI testing.
- Massive documentation rewrite (among the use of `#![deny(missing_docs)]`. The situation is still
  not perfect and patch versions will be released to fix and update the documentation. Step by
  step.
- Massive dependencies update. Special thanks to @eijebong for his help!
