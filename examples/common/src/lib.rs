//! Luminance examples.
//!
//! This project provides a set of examples that can be run on any platform. The examples are made platform-agnostic on
//! purpose, so that running them on e.g. a WebGL or OpenGL backend can be done once for the whole set of examples.
//!
//! # Example architecture
//!
//! Examples are simple modules exposed from this crate. They do not depend on any platform-specific concepts, such as
//! system events or system window capacities. For that reason, whenever an example requires user interaction, an
//! abstract type is used from this crate, which is exposed by the platform code running the example.
//!
//! Examples are responsible in allocating the luminance resources and implementing any loop / one-shot effects by using
//! the [`Example`] trait.
//!
//! # Error handling
//!
//! Examples being examples, they showcase the happy path of the code, not the failure path. For this reason, for now,
//! errors are not handled in any way and just rely on using `.unwrap()` / `.expect()`. This is bad style and will
//! eventually change, so keep in mind that:
//!
//! - If you want to write solid and smart Rust code, you want to handle errors, not rely on panics.
//! - This is example code, so don’t blindly copy it, try to understand it first.
