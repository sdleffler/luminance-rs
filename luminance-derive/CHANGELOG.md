- Support of `luminance-0.37`.

# 0.4

> Fri Sep 20th 2019

## Major changes

- Add `new` methods for types annotated with `Vertex`. This is considered a breaking change as
  it would break your code if you already have a `new` method, which is very likely.

## Minor changes

- Add support for struct-tuple when deriving `Vertex`.

## Patch changes

- Empty `Semantics` types are forbidden and now reported correctly as errors.
