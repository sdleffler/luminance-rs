# 0.29

> Thursday, 12th of July, 2018

  - Augment the `UniformInterface` trait with an *environment type variable*. This is used to pass
    more data when generating the uniform interface and enable *value-driven* implementations. The
    `UniformInterface::uniform_interface` method receives the environment as a second argument now.
  - Add `Program::*_env` creation functions to pass an environment value.
  - Add `Program::adapt`, `Program::adapt_env` to change the type of the uniform interface of a
    shader program without interacting / deallocating / reallocating anything on the GPU side.
  - Add `Program::readapt_env` to perform the same thing as `Program::adapt_env` but disallow
    changing the type of the uniform interface. This is very useful if you need to update any
    *value-driven* objects in your interface.

# 0.28

> Tuesday, 3rd of July, 2018

  - Change the `Uniformable` definition. The `dim` method disappeared and the `Dim` type doesn’t
    exist anymore has dimensions were merged into `Type`.
  - Add support for typed textures in uniform type reification for a better type mismatch error
    detection.
  - Fix the texture example so that it doesn’t use `#[unbound]` anymore. This is a simple change yet
    it will help not bringing confusion when people try to play with the example.

## 0.27.2

> Friday, 29th of June, 2018

  - Remove the `const_fn` feature gate, making the crate now completely compile on the *stable*
    channel!

## 0.27.1

> Thursday, 28th of June, 2018

  - Fix some `Cargo.toml` metadata.

# 0.27

> Thursday, 28th of June, 2018

  - Tag some unsafe traits with the `unsafe` keyword. Those traits are not supposed to be
    implemented by end-users but if they do, they might break the internal behavior of the crate, so
    the unsafety tag is necessary.
  - Use an algebraic type for encoding pixel channel size instead of `u8`.
  - Remove the `Result` type aliases used pretty much everywhere. Even though you can find them in
    `std::*`, those are considered of bad taste and lead to confusion.
  - Fix `std::error::Error` implementors. Especially, the `description` methode implementation was
    removed.
  - Disable face culling by default. This default choice was motivated by #60: people didn’t see the
    triangle they specified and thought of a bug.
  - Rename `Framebuffer::default` into `Framebuffer::back_buffer`. Again, this is motivated by a
    user incomprehension about the behavior (see #65).
  - Some internal change to boost and take advantage of the use of the GPU state tracking.
  - Clean up the interface.
  - Made `BoundBuffer` and `BoundTexture` types easier to use. Especially, you’re not supposed to
    pass `Buffer<_>` nor `Texture<_, _, _>` anymore as it’s automatically inferred.
  - Replace `TessRender` with `TessSlice` and use the `Index<_>` notation to create such objects.
    This is a simple yet great change as you don’t have to tweak around `&TessRender` anymore and
    can directly use the `.slice(_)` method.
  - Enhance the overall documentation once again.
  - Add a bunch of examples. You can find them in the directory [examples](./examples). They consist
    of a cargo workspace with one cargo project per example. Feel free to read the top documentation
    and in-code documentation of each `main.rs` for further information. Also, if you would like to
    learn something new (or if you think an example is missing to understand something), feel free
    to open a PR / issue; any kind of contribution is warmly welcomed!

# 0.26

> Sunday, 17th of June, 2018

  - Enhanced the overall documentation.
  - Fix a (GPU) memory leak in `RawBuffer` when dropping the object. The memory leak is not present
    if you never convert a `Buffer<_>` into `RawBuffer` because the GPU resource is correctly
    dropped when the `Buffer<_>` is dropped. Thus, if you don’t use `Buffer::to_raw`, you never had
    leaks.
  - Add a TLS system to create `GraphicsState`. Such objects can be generated only once per thread,
    making the creation of a `GraphicsContext` safer. This also enforces having a single context per
    thread.
  - Introduce the `GraphicsContext` trait and `GraphicsState` type.
  - Huge refactoring of the library in order to make it thread-safe.
  - Update the README to add crates comparisons.

## 0.25.7

> Tuesday, 20th of March, 2018

  - Fix `BoundBuffer` type reification in `Uniformable`.

## 0.25.6

> Sunday, 18th of March, 2018

  - Added the `TessRender::one_slice` function.

## 0.25.5

> Tuesday, 13th of February, 2018

  - Support for `gl-0.10`.

## 0.25.4

> Monday, 12th of February, 2018

  - Support visibility in `uniform_interface!`.

## 0.25.3

> Monday, 12th of February, 2018

  - Fixed some doc’s typo.

## 0.25.2

> Sunday, 11th of February, 2018

  - Added a `uniform_interface!` macro. That enables to create a new `struct` type and have inspection
    of its fields at compile-time so that a `UniformInterface impl` is automatically generated. This
    is a kind of _custom auto derive_ without depending on proc-macro. Feel free to use it as it’ll
    remove a lot of boilerplate from your code.
  - Cleanup of internal code.

## 0.25.1

  - Fixed the pixel formats support on the OpenGL side.

# 0.25

> Thursday, 14th of December, 2017

  - Replaced the `Uniformable` implementation for `pipeline::Bound*` to `&pipeline::Bound*`. This
    enables sharing of bound resources instead of dropping and re-binding the resources.

## 0.24.1

> Monday, 11th of December, 2017

  - Added more color and renderable pixel formats (all sized supported).

# 0.24

> Thursday, 9th of November, 2017

  - Added support for *face culling*.
  - Enhanced the interface of render gates with `RenderState`.

## 0.23.1

> Monday, 2nd of October, 2017

  - Implemented `Display` and `Error` for error types.

# 0.23

> September 10th 2017

  - Added `Program::from_strings`.
  - Patch: internal function that used `Option` to express an error via `Some(err)` replaced by
    `Result<(), _>` and the more appropriate `Err(err)`.

## 0.22.7

  - Use the `pub(crate)` construct to hide some `unsafe` functions and remove `unsafe` annotation on
    some of them. The safety annotation was used so that it discouraged users to use the functions.
    Now that we have a proper way to express access-control, we can remove `unsafe`.

## 0.22.6

  - Fixed MRT with more than two color slots.
  - Fixed segfault on uniform introspection on some hardware.

## 0.22.5

  - Added the `readme` attribute to `Cargo.toml` so that it gets rendered on
  [crates.io](https://crates.io).

## 0.22.4

  - Added some impl of `RenderablePixel`.

## 0.22.3

  - Enforce static type of `Tess::attributeless`. It now only works with `Tess<()>`.

## 0.22.2

  - Enforce lifetimes on `BoundTexture` and `BoundBuffer`. It’s there so that such objects cannot
    live longer than the references on the `Texture<_>` and `Buffer<_>` they’re based on.

## 0.22.1

  - Better implementation of texture and buffer binding.

# 0.22

  - Added the `Gpu` type, handling stateful operations on the GPU.
  - Rework of the `pipeline` module. It might change a lot in the near future.

## 0.21.3

  - Some `tess` and `buffer` types now implement some standard traits (`Debug`, `Eq`, `PartialEq`).

## 0.21.2

  - Updated the documentation.

## 0.21.1

  - `Tess::as_slice{,_mut}` now don’t need type annotations anymore and provide slices typed by `V`.
  - Added `as_slice{,_mut}` to `Buffer` directly, setting the phantom type to what the `Buffer<_>`
    holds – it’s safer and will remove type annotations in client code, much cool!

# 0.21

  - Renamed `Chain` into `GTup` and added some macros.
  - Made `Framebuffer::{color,depth}_slot` private and provided accessors.

# 0.20

  - Typed shader programs are re-introduced. They now accept three type variables: the input of the
    shader program, its output and its uniform interface. The output is currently unused. A lot of
    things were added, documentation is not up to date and will come in the next release.
  - Vertex-typed tessellations are now a thing – it’s implemented so that the input type used in typed
    shader programs has a sense. The `CompatibleVertex` trait must be implemented when a tessellation
    having more than the required set of vertex components is used and must adapt to the shader input.
  - `Texture::Dim` is now (mostly) an array instead of a tuple.

# 0.19

  - `Into<Option<_>>` elegancy additions.
  - Changed the whole pipeline system. It’s now a traversal-like system.

## 0.18.2

  - Fixed some internal code about pipelines.
  - Fixed some internal code about texture set binding.
  - `RenderCommand::new` is now polymorphic in its blending argument.

## 0.18.1

  - Support for the latest `gl` crate.

# 0.18

  - `TessRender` now implements `From` for basic cases.
  - All pipeline types now implement `Clone`.
  - Pipeline types have lost ownership of subcommands (shading commands, render commands, etc.). This
    is a very important change made so that we can have more sharing and then expect a performance
    boost.

## 0.17.2

  - Fixed variance of `BufferSlice*`.

## 0.17.1

  - Enhanced the interface of pipes.
  - Rewrote the documentation.

# 0.17

  - Added mipmap texture filtering to `texture::MagFilter`.
  - Splitted `texture::Filter` into `texture::MinFilter` and `texture::MagFilter` for a better static
    safety.
  - Rewrite of pipelines. Their `Pipe` don’t accept a `Fn` closure anymore – see the point just below.
    Pipes are now created without the assumptions of anything else, and you can add *uniforms*,
    *uniform buffers* or *textures* as you see fit. The interface is designed in a way that no
    breaking changes will happen if another type of resources is added in the future.
  - Introduced `AlterUniform`. This type adds purity to alter uniforms. You cannot change the value
    of uniforms as you used to – via a `T: Fn`. This is because updating a uniform shouldn’t enable
    you to execute code as freely as you’d wish. The semantic is *“update the uniform”*.
    `AlterUniform` implements such a semantic.
  - Free some structs from useless trait bounds.
  - Unsupported pixel formats are now shown in a panic. Those should never arrive in a client code.
    The panics are just for developping luminance; which is then justified.
  - `R32F` pixel format was introduced.
  - Introduced `TessRender`. This type is great as it enables you to render a sub-part of a `Tess` if
    you want to, or change the number of instances you want. It’s a clearer interface than the
    previous one.
  - Internal code clean up.
  - It’s now possible to reserve GPU memory for vertices without filling tessellations. This choice
    is made via the `TessVertices` type.
  - Fixed a panic on `Framebuffer::new()`.
  - Added `RawTexture` and `RawBuffer`. Those types are type-erased versions of `Texture<_, _, _>` and
    `Buffer<_>`, respectively, used to pass them via heterogeneous slices for instance. There’s a
    `Deref` implementation that automatically promotes them to the raw equivalent.
  - Added `UniformWarning` to the public interface.
  - Merged `luminance-gl` into `luminance`. This decision is intended to make the use of luminance
    easier and take advantage of the underlying technology (in the current case,
    [OpenGL 3.3](https://www.opengl.org). The idea is that abstracting over several low-level
    graphics API makes it almost impossible to abstract them in a unified way and still be able to
    take full advantages of them, because they also provide very specific primitives and way of
    working with them that preclude any abstraction. Keep in mind that the low-level technology used
    also has an important impact on the design of the higher level API – to, actually, take advantage
    of it and keep performance as high as possible. Thank you for your attention.

# 0.16

  - `BufferSlice{,Mut}` now implements `IntoIterator`.
  - Some internal changes.
  - Vertices (`Vertex`) are now aligned based on what decides the Rust compiler. This is very
    important, especially because of the version 0.15.0 adding non-32-bit vertex components: alignment
    and padding is now completely handled for you and you have nothing to care about.
  - Added some documentation here and there.
  - Changed the meaning of the semantic maps (uniforms). It is now required to provide a `Uniform` to
    build a new `Sem`. This is an improvement in the sense that the *unsafe* zone is restricted to the
    declaration of uniforms for a given program. This *unsafe* zone will be covered in a next release
    by a macro to make it safe.
  - `texturee::Unit` cannot be used in a uniform block context (it doesn’t have sense on the GLSL
    side).
  - Added some more types to `UniformBlock`. This trait is not very useful yet, but it’s required to
    make a `Buffer` readable from GLSL.

# 0.15

  - Texture and framebuffers have several functions that can fail with new errors.
  - Added buffer mapping. See `BufferSlice` and `BufferSliceMut` for further details.
  - `Tessellation` is now called `Tess` for simplicity (because it’s used **a lot**).
  - `VertexComponentFormat::comp_size` is now a `usize`.
  - The `Vertex` trait now accepts a lot more of new types (among changes, added support for
    non-32-bit vertex components).

# 0.14

  - `UniformWarning::TypeMismatch` now includes the name of the uniform which type mismatches with the
    requested on.
  - `Pipeline::Pipe` is now exported by the common interface.
  - `Uniform::sem` doesn’t require `&self` anymore.
  - `Uniform::new` is now a const fn.

## 0.13.1

  - Added `Uniform::sem()` function to create `Sem` out of `Uniform<C, T>` in a simpler way.

# 0.13

  - Changed the pipeline workflow by introducing `Pipe` objects.
  - Removed strong typing in shader programs (`Program<C, T>` is now `Program<C>`).
  - Removed strong typing in shader stages (`Stage<C, T>` is now `Stage<C>`).

## 0.12.1

  - Added `Binding` and `Unit` in the default export-list.

# 0.12

  - Added attribute-less tessellations.
  - Enhanced shader-related documentation.
  - Removed `Slot`.

# 0.11

  - Added the first, constraint-only, `UniformBlock` trait. Used to restrict types that can be passed
    around in uniform buffers.
  - Added *proxied* types – i.e. `TextureProxy` and `UniformBufferProxy`. Those are used to build sets
    that can passed to shaders.
  - Uniform buffers can now be sent to shaders via the `buffer::Binding` type. Put your buffer in a
    uniform buffer set and there you go.
  - Textures are not `Uniformable` anymore. You have to put the texture in a texture set and use a
    `texture::Unit`, which is `Uniformable`.
  - Added `buffer::Binding`.
  - Added `texture::Unit`.
  - `map_uniform` now takes `&str` instead of `String`.
  - Cleaned up documentation.
  - Fixed internal bugs.

# 0.10

  - Fixed the type of the uniform errors in the uniform interface builder function.

## 0.9.1

  - Documentation updates.

# 0.9

  - Several textures can now be passed as uniforms to shaders. The interface is pretty instable as it
    might change in the future, because for now, the user has to pass the texture units each textures
    should be bound to.

# 0.8

  - Documentation is now available on docs.rs.
  - Replaced references to `Vec` by slices.

# 0.7

  - Uniforms have new semantics; mapping them cannot fail anymore but it can be emitted warnings.

## 0.6.4

  - Backends now have more information to work with about uniforms. That enables using reification
    techniques to validate types, dimensions, sizes, etc…

## 0.6.3

  - Added `get_raw_texels` to `Texture`.

## 0.6.2

  - Added `upload_part_raw` and `upload_raw` to `Texture`, enabling to upload raw texels instead of
    texels directly.
  - Added `RawEncoding` to `Pixel`.

## 0.6.1

  - Added documentation field in Cargo.toml.

# 0.6

  - Removed `Default` implementation for `Framebuffer` and added a new `default()` method, taking the
    size of the `Framebuffer`.
  - Added `RenderablePixel` trait bound on `Slot` implementations for `ColorPixel`.
  - Added `RenderablePixel`.
  - Removed the need of the **core** crate.
  - Removed `UniformName`.
  - We can now have textures as uniforms.
  - New uniform system to accept value depending on the backend.
  - Using `AsRef` instead of ATexture in `update_textures`.
  - Changed the meaning of mipmaps (now it’s the number of extra mipmaps).
  - Using `usize` instead of `u32` for mipmaps.
  - Added `Dimensionable` and `Layerable` in the interface.

## 0.5.3

  - Added `update_textures` into `HasUniform`.
  - Fixed signature of `UniformUpdate::update`.
  - Fixed trait bound on `UniformUpdate::{contramap, update}`.

## 0.5.2

  - Added `UniformUpdate`.
  - Added `Uniformable` in the public interfarce shortcut.

## 0.5.1

  - Removed `run_pipeline` and added `Pipeline::run`.

# 0.5

  - Fixed uniform interfaces in `ShadingCommand` and `RenderCommand` with existential quantification.
  - Renamed `FrameCommand` into `Pipeline`.
  - Several patch fixes.
  - Added travis CI support.
  - Added documentation for `Program`.

# 0.4

  - Changed the whole `Program` API to make it safer. Now, it closely looks like the Haskell version
    of `luminance`. The idea is that the user cannot have `Uniform`s around anymore as they’re held by
    `Program`s. Furthermore, the *uniform interface* is introduced. Because Rust doesn’t have a
    **“rank-2 types”** mechanism as Haskell, `ProgramProxy` is introduced to emulate such a behavior.
  - Added a bit of documentation for shader programs.

## 0.3.1

  - Removed `rw`.

# 0.3

  - Removed A type parameter form `Buffer`. It was unnecessary safety that was never actually used.
  - Added documentation around.

## 0.2.1

  - Exposed `Vertex` directly in `luminance`.

# 0.2

  - Changed `Negative*` blending factors to `*Complement`.

# 0.1

  - Initial revision.
