//! Vertex formats, associated types and functions.
//!
//! A vertex is a type representing a point. It’s common to find vertex positions, normals, colors
//! or even texture coordinates. However, you’re free to use whichever type you want. Nevertheless,
//! you’re limited to a range of types and dimensions. See `Type` and `Dim` for further details.
//!
//! # `Vertex`
//!
//! ## Rules
//!
//! To be able to use a type as a vertex, you have to implement the `Vertex` trait. That trait
//! represents a mapping between your type and `VertexFormat`. A `VertexFormat` gives runtime hints
//! about your type and restricts the supported type. If you cannot map your type to `VertexFormat`,
//! that means you cannot use it as a `Vertex`.
//!
//! The rule is that your type should have a static size greater than 0 and less than or equal to 4.
//! It should also be either integral, unsigned, floating or boolean. If your type is a complex one
//! – for instance a `struct` – you have to recursively apply that rule to all its fields.
//! For instance, the tuple `(i32, bool)` implements `Vertex` by providing an implementation using
//! the ones of `i32` and `bool`.
//!
//! ## Components list
//!
//! As mentionned above, you can use tuples and structs as `Vertex`. If you look at the definition
//! of `VertexFormat`, you’ll notice that it’s a `Vec<VertexComponentFormat>`. That means simple
//! and primary types map to unit vectors – i.e. their size is 1 – but tuples and structs need
//! several `VertexComponentFormat`s to be represented, hence vectors with sizes greater than 1. No
//! check is made on how many vertex components you’re using – there’s a practical limit, set by the
//! GPU, but it’s not checked (yet).
//!
//! # Generic implementation
//!
//! You have `Vertex` implementations for all the primary types that can be mapped to
//! `VertexFormat`. However, as it’s not possible to automatically implement `Vertex` for your
//! structure (yet?), a type is provided to help you design your vertex type so that you’re
//! automatically provided with a `Vertex` implementation if you use `Chain`.
//!
//! `Chain` is a special type used to represent static list of types. With that in hand, you can
//! easily create `Vertex` types and start using them without even implementing `Vertex`, as long as
//! you use `Vertex` types. Feel free to dig in the `Chain` documentation for further details.
//!
//! If you absolutely want to use your own types – which is legit, you can to implement `Vertex` by
//! mapping your inner fields to tuples, and call the right `Vertex` method on that tuple.
