//! Shader programs related types and functions.
//!
//! A shader `Program` is an object representing several operations. It’s a streaming program that
//! will operate on vertices, vertex patches, primitives and/or fragments.
//!
//! > *Note: shader programs don’t have to run on all those objects; they can be ran only on
//! vertices and fragments, for instance*.
//!
//! Creating a shader program is very simple. You need shader `Stage`s representing each step of the
//! processing. Here’s the actual mapping between the shader stage types and the processing unit:
//!
//! - `Stage<TessellationControlShader>`: ran on **tessellation parameters** ;
//! - `Stage<TessellationEvaluationShader>`: ran on **patches** ;
//! - `Stage<VertexShader>`: ran on **vertices** ;
//! - `Stage<GeometryShader>`: ran on **primitives** ;
//! - `Stage<FragmentShader>`: ran on **screen fragments**.
//!
//! You *have* to provide at least a `Stage<VertexShader>` and a `Stage<FragmentShader>`. If you
//! want tessellation processing, you need to provide both a `Stage<TessellationControlShader>` and
//! a `Stage<TessellationEvaluationShader>`. If you want primitives processing, you need to add a
//! `Stage<GeometryShader>`.
//!
//! In order to customize the behavior of your shader programs, you have access to *uniforms*. For
//! more details about them, see the documentation for the type `Uniform` and `Uniformable`. When
//! creating a new shader program, you have to provide code to declare its *uniform interface*. The
//! *uniform interface* refers to a type of your own that will be kept by the shader program and
//! exposed to you when you’ll express the need to update its uniforms. That *uniform interface* is
//! created via a closure you pass. That closure takes as arguments a `ProgramProxy` used to
//! retrieve `Uniform`s from the program being constructed. That pattern, that can be a bit
//! overwhelming at first, is important to keep things safe and functional. Keep in mind that you
//! can make the closure fail, so that you can notify a `Uniform` lookup failure, for instance.
//!
//! You can create a `Program` with its `new` associated function.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! // assume we have a vertex shader `vs` and fragment shader `fs`
//! let program = Program::new(None, &vs, None, &fs, |get_uni| {
//!   let resolution: Uniform<[f32; 2]> = try!(get_uni("resolution"));
//!   let time: Uniform<f32> = try!(get_uni("time"));
//!
//!   Ok((resolution, time))
//! });
//! ```
