//! Dynamic rendering pipelines.
//!
//! This module gives you types and functions to build *dynamic* rendering **pipelines**. A
//! pipeline represents a functional stream that consumes geometric data and rasterizes them.
//!
//! When you want to build a render, the main entry point is the `entry` function. It gives you a
//! `Gpu` object that enables you to perform stateful graphics operations.
//!
//! # Key concepts
//!
//! luminance exposes several concepts you have to be familiar with:
//!
//! - render buffers;
//! - blending;
//! - shaders;
//! - tessellations;
//! - gates;
//! - render commands;
//! - shading commands;
//! - pipelines;
//!
//! # Render buffers
//!
//! The render buffers are GPU-allocated memory regions used while rendering images into
//! framebuffers. Typically, a framebuffer has at least three buffers:
//!
//! - a *color buffer*, that will receive texels (akin to pixels, but for textures/buffers);
//! - a *depth buffer*, a special buffer mostly used to determine whether a fragment (pixel) is
//!   behind something that was previously rendered – it’s a simple solution to discard render that
//!   won’t be visible anyway;
//! - a *stencil buffer*, which often acts as a mask to create interesting effects to your renders.
//!
//! luminance gives you access to the first two – the stencil buffer will be added in a future
//! release.
//!
//! Alternatively, you can also tell your GPU that you won’t be using a depth buffer, or that you
//! need several color buffers – this is called [MRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Render_Targets).
//! In most frameworks, you create some textures to hold the color information, then you “bind” them
//! to your pipeline, and you’re good to go. In luminance, everything happens at the type level: you
//! say to luminance which type of framebuffer you want (for instance, a framebuffer with two color
//! outputs and a depth buffer). luminance will handle the textures for you – you can retrieve access
//! to them whenever you want to.
//!
//! If you have a depth buffer, you can ask luminance to perform a depth test that will discard any
//! fragment being “behind” the fragment already in place. You can also give luminance the *clear
//! color* it must use when you issue a new pipeline to fill the buffers.
//!
//! # Blending
//!
//! When you render a fragment A at a position P in a framebuffer, there are several configurations:
//!
//! - you have a depth buffer and the depth test is enabled: in that case, no blending will happen
//!   as either the already in-place fragment will be chosen or the new one you try to write,
//!   depending on the result of the depth test;
//! - the depth test is disabled: in that case, each time a fragment is to be written to a place in
//!   a buffer, its output will be blended with the color already present according to a *blending
//!   equation* and two *blending factors*.
//!
//! # Shaders
//!
//! Shaders in luminance are pretty simple: you have `Stage` that represents each type of shader
//! stages you can use, and `Program`, that links them into a GPU executable.
//!
//! In luminance, you’re supposed to create a `Program` with `Stage`. Some of them are mandatory and
//! others are optional. In order to customize your build, you can use a *uniform interface*. The
//! uniform interface is defined by our own type. When you create a program, you pass code to tell
//! luminance how to get such a type. Then that type will be handed back to you when needed in the
//! form of an immutable object.
//!
//! # Tessellations
//!
//! The `Tess` type represents a tessellation associated with a possible set of GPU vertices and
//! indices. Note that it’s also possible to create *attributeless* tesselations – i.e.
//! tessellations that don’t own any vertices nor indices and are used with specific shaders only.
//!
//! # Gates
//!
//! The gate concept is quite easy to understand: picture a pipeline as tree. Each node is typed,
//! hence, the structure is quite limited to what your GPU can understand. Gates are a way to
//! spread information of root nodes down. For instance, if you have a shader node, every nested
//! child of that shader node will have the possibility to use its features via a shading gate.
//!
//! # Render commands
//!
//! A set of values that tag a collection of tessellations. Typical information is whether we should
//! use a depth test, the blending factors and equation, etc.
//!
//! # Shading commands
//!
//! A set of values that tag a collection of render commands. Typical information is a shader
//! program along with its uniform interface.
//!
//! # Pipelines
//!
//! A pipeline is just an aggregation of shadings commands with a few extra information.
