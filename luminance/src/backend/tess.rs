/// _break_ the building of a primitive to _start over again_. For instance, when making a curve,
/// you can imagine gluing segments next to each other. If at some point, you want to start a new
/// line, you have two choices:
///
///   - Either you stop your draw call and make another one.
///   - Or you just use the _primitive restart_ feature to ask to create another line from scratch.
///
/// That feature is encoded with a special _vertex index_. You can setup the value of the _primitive
/// restart index_ with [`TessBuilder::set_primitive_restart_index`]. Whenever a vertex index is set
/// to the same value as the _primitive restart index_, the value is not interpreted as a vertex
/// index but just a marker / hint to start a new primitive.
