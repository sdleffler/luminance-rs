//! Shader backend interface.
//!
//! This interface defines the low-level API shaders must implement to be usable.
//!
//! Shader support is quite complex and requires several concepts to be implemented by the backend. The first one is the
//! concept of « shader stage ». A shader stage represents a single logic of shader processing. Oftentimes, backends
//! support at least two of them:
//!
//! - Vertex shader, which is run for all vertices.
//! - Fragment shader, which is run for all fragments rasterized by the backend.
//!
//! Other backends support optional backend stages, such as:
//!
//! - Geometry shader, which is run for every primitive (point, lines, triangles, etc.).
//! - Tessellation shaders, run to tessellate the vertex stream.
//! - Compute shaders, special kind of shaders used to compute non-image related data on the backend using the shader
//!   pipeline.
//!
//! Then, the concept of a « shader program », which agregates shader stages into a single entity after a process of «
//! linking » the various shader stages. A shader program is a pipeline resource, so it will be used inside a graphics
//! pipeline to shade a scene. At the higher level, shader programs are typed with different type variables that don’t
//! leak in the backend, but some have meaning, which is a good transition to the next concept: uniforms. In this
//! backend, uniforms are user-defined structures that can only be built by backend-specific ways. This is why another
//! trait must be implement do perform all the lookups and uniforms construction.
//!
//! Finally, some traits exist to provide more features, such as [`ShaderData`] to support shader data operations.
