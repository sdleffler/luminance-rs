//! # GPU geometries.
//!
//! Tessellations (i.e. [`Tess`]) represent geometric information stored on GPU. They are at the
//! heart of any render, should it be 2D, 3D or even more exotic configuration. Please familiarize
//! yourself with the tessellation abstractions before going on.
//!
//! # Tessellation primitive
//!
//! Currently, several kinds of tessellation are supported:
//!
//! - [`Mode::Point`]; _point clouds_.
//! - [`Mode::Line`]; _lines_.
//! - [`Mode::LineStrip`]; _line strips_, which are lines connected between them to create a single,
//!   long line.
//! - [`Mode::Triangle`]; _triangles_.
//! - [`Mode::TriangleFan`]; _triangle fans_, a way of connecting triangles.
//! - [`Mode::TriangleStrip`]; _triangle strips_, another way of connecting triangles.
//! - [`Mode::Patch`]; _patches_, the primitives that tessellation shaders operate on.
//!
//! Those kinds of tessellation are designated by the [`Mode`] type. You will also come across the
//! name of _primitive mode_ to designate such an idea.
//!
//! # Tessellation creation
//!
//! Creation is done via the [`TessBuilder`] type, using the _builder_ pattern. Once you’re done
//! with configuring everything, you can generate the tessellation and get a [`Tess`] object.
//!
//! [`Tess`] represents data on the GPU and can be thought of as an access to the actual data, a bit
//! in the same way as a [`Vec`] is just a small data structure that represents an access to a
//! much bigger memory area.
//!
//! # Tessellation render
//!
//! In order to render a [`Tess`], you have to use a [`TessSlice`] object. You’ll be able to use
//! that object in *pipelines*. See the [pipeline] module for further details.

/// line, you have two choices:
///
///   - Either you stop your draw call and make another one.
///   - Or you just use the _primitive restart_ feature to ask to create another line from scratch.

/// That feature is encoded with a special _vertex index_. You can setup the value of the _primitive
/// restart index_ with [`TessBuilder::set_primitive_restart_index`]. Whenever a vertex index is set

/// This type allows you to create [`Tess`] by specifying piece-by-piece what the tessellation is
/// made of. Several situations and configurations are supported.
///
/// # Specifying vertices
///
/// If you want to create a [`Tess`] holding vertices without anything else, you want to use the
/// [`TessBuilder::add_vertices`]. Every time that function is called, a _vertex buffer_ is
/// virtually allocated for your tessellation, which gives you three possibilities:
///
/// ## 1. Attributeless [`Tess`]
///
/// If you don’t call that function, you end up with an _attributeless_ tessellation. Such a
/// tessellation has zero memory allocated to vertices. Instead, when invoking a _vertex shader_,
/// the vertices must be created on the fly _inside_ the vertex shader directly.
///
/// ## 2. Interleaved [`Tess`]
///
/// If you call that function once, you have a single _vertex buffer_ allocated, which either
/// gives you a 1-attribute tessellation, or an interleaved tessellation. Interleaved tessellation
/// allows you to use a Rust `struct` (if it implements the [`Vertex`] trait) as vertex type and
/// easily fetch them from a vertex shader.
///
/// ## 3. Deinterleaved [`Tess`]
///
/// If you call that function several times, the [`TessBuilder`] assumes you want _deinterleaved_
/// memory, which means that each patch of vertices you add is supposed to contain one type of
/// deinterleaved vertex attributes. A coherency check is done by the [`TessBuilder`] to ensure
/// the vertex data is correct.
///
/// # Specifying indices
///
/// By default, vertices are picked in the order you specify them in the vertex buffer(s). If you
/// want more control on the order, you can add _indices_.
///
/// As soon as you provide indices, the [`TessBuilder`] will change the way [`Tess`] will fetch
/// vertices. Instead of fetching the first vertex, then second, then third, etc., it will first
/// fetch the first index, then the second, then third, and respectively use the value of those
/// indices to fetch the actual vertices.
///
/// For instance, if instead of fetching vertices `[1, 2, 3`] (which is the default) you want to
/// fetch `[12, 35, 2]`, you can add the `[12, 35, 2]` indices in the [`TessBuilder`]. When
/// rendering, the [`Tess`] will fetch the first index and get `12`; it will then make the first
/// vertex to be fetched the 12th; then fetch the second index; get `35` and fetch the 35th vertex.
/// Finally, as you might have guessed, it will fetch the third index, get `2` and then the third
/// vertex to be fetched will be the second one.
///
/// That feature is really important as it allows you to _factorize_ vertices: instead of
/// duplicating them, you can just reuse their indices.
///
/// You can have only one set of indices. See the [`TessBuilder::set_indices`] function.
///
/// # Specifying vertex instancing
///
/// It’s also possible to provide instancing information. Those are special vertex attributes that
/// are picked on an _instance_-based information instead of _vertex number_ one. It works very
/// similarly to how vertices data work, but on a per-instance bases.
///
