///   - The memory layout of your vertex buffers might be very different from an ideal case or even

///     a mapping is needed.
///   - Sometimes, a shader just need a few information from the vertex attributes. You then want to

///     varieties of vertex formats.
///
/// Vertex attribute semantics are any type that can implement this trait. The idea is that
/// semantics must be unique. The vertex position should have an index that is never used anywhere
/// else in the vertex buffer. Because of the second point above, it’s also highly recommended
/// (even though valid not to) to stick to the same index for a given semantics when you have
/// several tessellations – that allows better composition with shaders. Basically, the best advice
