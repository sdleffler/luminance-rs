//! Vertex formats, associated types and functions.
//!
//! A vertex is a type representing a point. It’s common to find vertex positions, normals, colors
//! or even texture coordinates. However, you’re free to use whichever type you want. Nevertheless,
//! you’re limited to a range of types and dimensions. See `VertexAttribType` and `VertexAttribDim` for further details.
//!
//! # `Vertex`
//!
//! ## Rules
//!
//! To be able to use a type as a vertex, you have to implement the `Vertex` trait. That trait
//! represents a mapping between your type and `VertexFmt`. A `VertexFmt` gives runtime hints
//! about your type and restricts the supported type. If you cannot map your type to `VertexFmt`,
//! that means you cannot use it as a `Vertex`.
//!
//! The rule is that your type should have a static size greater than 0 and less than or equal to 4.
//! It should also be either integral, unsigned, floating or boolean. If your type is a complex one
//! – for instance a `struct` – you have to recursively apply that rule to all its fields.
//! For instance, the tuple `(i32, bool)` implements `Vertex` by providing an implementation using
//! the ones of `i32` and `bool`.
//!
//! ## Attributes list
//!
//! As mentionned above, you can use tuples and structs as `Vertex`. If you look at the definition
//! of `VertexFmt`, you’ll notice that it’s a `Vec<VertexAttribFmt>`. That means simple
//! and primary types map to unit vectors – i.e. their size is 1 – but tuples and structs need
//! several `VertexAttribFmt`s to be represented, hence vectors with sizes greater than 1. No
//! check is made on how many vertex attributes you’re using – there’s a practical limit, set by the
//! GPU, but it’s not checked (yet).
//!
//! # Generic implementation
//!
//! You have `Vertex` implementations for all the primary types that can be mapped to
//! `VertexFmt`. However, as it’s not possible to automatically implement `Vertex` for your
//! structure (yet?), a type is provided to help you design your vertex type so that you’re
//! automatically provided with a `Vertex` implementation if you use `GTup`.
//!
//! `GTup` is a special type used to represent static heterogeneous list of types. With that in
//! hand, you can easily create `Vertex` types and start using them without even implementing
//! `Vertex`, as long as you use `Vertex` types. Feel free to dig in the `GTup` documentation for
//! further details.
//!
//! If you absolutely want to use your own types – which is legit, you can implement `Vertex` by
//! mapping your inner fields to a tuple or `GTup`, and call the right `Vertex` method on that
//! tuple.

/// A type that can be used as a `Vertex` has to implement that trait – it must provide a mapping
/// to `VertexFmt`.
///
/// If you’re not sure on how to implement that or if you want to use automatic types, feel free
/// to use the primary supported types and `GTup` or tuples.

///
/// Vertex attribute semantics are a mean to make shaders and vertex buffers talk to each other
/// correctly. This is important for several reasons:
///
///   - The memory layout of your vertex buffers might be very different from an ideal case or even
///     the common case. Shaders don’t have any way to know where to pick vertex attributes from, so
///     a mapping is needed.
///   - Sometimes, a shader just need a few information from the vertex attributes. You then want to
///     be able to authorize _“gaps”_ in the semantics so that shaders can be used for several
///     varieties of vertex formats.
///
/// Vertex attribute semantics are any types that can implement this trait. The idea is that
/// semantics must be unique. The vertex position should have an index that is never used anywhere
/// else in the vertex buffer. Because of the second point above, it’s also highly recommended
/// (even though valid) to stick to the same index for a given semantics when you have several
/// tessellations – that allows better compositing with shaders. Basically, the best advice to
/// follow: define your semantics once, and keep to them.
