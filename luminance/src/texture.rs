//! GPU textures.
//!
//! A GPU texture is an object that can be perceived as an array on the GPU. It holds several items
//! and is a dimensional object. Textures are often associated with _images_, even though their
//! usage in the graphics world can be much larger than that.
//!
//! Textures ([`Texture`]) come in several flavors and the differences lie in:
//!
//! - The dimensionality: textures can be 1D, 2D, 3D, layered, cube maps, etc. Dimension is encoded
//!   via the [`Dim`] type, and indexed in the type-system with the [`Dimensionable`] and its
//!   implementors.
//! - The encoding: the _items_ inside textures are called _pixels_ or _texels_. Those can be
//!   encoded in several ways. They are represented by various types, which are implementors of the
//!   [`Pixel`] trait.
//! - The usage: some textures will be used as images, others will be used to pass arbitrary data
//!   around in shaders, etc.
//!
//! Whatever the flavor, textures have few uses outside of shaders. When a shader wants
//! to use a texture, it can do it directly, by accessing each pixel by their position inside the
//! texture (using a normalized coordinates system) or via the use of a [`Sampler`]. A [`Sampler`],
//! as the name implies, is an object that tells the GPU how fetching (sampling) a texture should
//! occur. Several options there too:
//!
//! - The GPU can fetch a pixel without sampling. It means that you have to pass the exact
//!   coordinates of the pixel you want to access. This is useful when you store arbitrary
//!   information, like UUID, velocities, etc.
//! - The GPU can fetch a pixel with a floating-point coordinates system. How that system works
//!   depends on the settings of [`Sampler`] you choose. For instance, you can always fetch the
//!   _nearest_ pixel to where you sample, or you can ask the GPU to perform a linear
//!   interpolation between all neighboring pixels, etc. [`Sampler`] allows way more than that, so
//!   feel free to read their documentation.
