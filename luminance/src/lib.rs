//!
//! [luminance] is an effort to make graphics rendering simple and elegant.
//!
//! The aims of [luminance] are:
//!
//!   - Bringing a **safe**, **type-safe** and **stateless** API to the Rust graphics ecosystem.
//!   - Providing a simple and easy interface; that is, exposing core concepts without anything
//!     extra – just the bare stuff. This is not a 3D or a video game engine. It’s a set of building
//!     blocks and graphics primitives you can use to construct more specific abstractions,
//!     libraries and applications.
//!   - To be opinionated enough to allow safety and optimizations but not to force the user into a
//!     too strict design: this is not a framework. Some constructs are restricting by design but
//!     the overall crate tries to adapt to what the user wants to do, not the over way around.
//!   - Easy to read with a good documentation and set of tutorials, so that newcomers don’t have to
//!     learn a lot of new concepts to get their feet wet. For most primitive concepts, they must
//!     be explained and detailed in their corresponding sections / modules.
//!   - Need-driven: every piece of code added in the project must come from a real use case. If you
//!     feel something is missing, feel free to open an issue or even contribute! Issue trackers
//!     exist for bug tracking but also for feature requests.
//!   - The [gfx-hal] crate is already a good crate, so [luminance] must stand out by providing an
//!     easier crate for people who just want to write some graphics code without having to cope
//!     with _too low-level_ details. The crate is low-level but not as much as [gfx-hal], though.
//!     The goal is to be _performant enough_ and still have an elegant and easy interface.
//!
//! An important point before starting: some people ask about how to _easily render something_.
//! [luminance] is flexible enough to allow people to do rendering as they want and, thus, doesn’t
//! include default shaders or such. So if you are looking for something that has already
//! _everything_ embedded, you’re not looking at the right crate.
//!
//! [luminance] is shipped with almost no _data_ — i.e. no default shader, tessellations, etc. You
//! can probably find crates adding those, though. ;)
//!
//! # What’s included?
//!
//! [luminance] is a rendering crate, not a 3D engine nor a video game framework. As so, it doesn’t
//! include specific concepts, such as lights, materials, asset management nor scene description. It
//! only provides a rendering library you can plug in whatever you want to.
//!
//!   > There are several so-called 3D-engines out there on [crates.io](https://crates.io). Feel
//!   > free to have a look around.
//!
//! However, [luminance] comes in with several interesting features that might interest you.
//!
//! ## Features set
//!
//!   - **Buffers**: buffers are ways to communicate with the GPU; they represent regions of memory
//!     you can write to and read from. There’re several kinds of buffers you can create, among
//!     *vertex and index buffers*, *uniform buffers*, and so on and so forth…. They look like
//!     regular array but have some differences you might be aware of.
//!   - **Framebuffers**: framebuffers are used to hold renders. Each time you want to perform a
//!     render, you need to perform it into a framebuffer. Framebuffers can then be combined with
//!     each other to produce effects and design render layers.
//!   - **Shaders**: [luminance] supports five kinds of shader stages:
//!       - Tessellation control shaders.
//!       - Tessellation evaluation shaders.
//!       - Vertex shaders.
//!       - Geometry shaders.
//!       - Fragment shaders.
//!   - **Vertices, indices, primitives and tessellations**: those are used to define a shape you
//!     can render into a framebuffer with a shader.
//!   - **Textures**: textures represent information packed into arrays on the GPU, and can be used
//!     to customize a visual aspect or pass information around in shaders.
//!   - **Blending**: blending is the process of taking two colors from two framebuffers and mixing
//!     them between each other.
//!   - **Control on the render state**: the render state is a set of capabilities you can tweak
//!     to draw frames. It includes:
//!       - The blending equation and factors.
//!       - Whether we should have a depth test performed.
//!       - Face culling.
//!   - And a lot of other cool things like *GPU commands*, *pipelines*, *uniform interfaces* and so on…
//!
//! # How to dig in?
//!
//! [luminance] is written to be fairly simple. The documentation is very transparent about what the
//! library does and several articles will appear as the development goes on. Keep tuned! The
//! [online documentation](https://docs.rs/luminance) is also a good link to have around.
//!
//! # Current implementation
//!
//! Currently, **luminance is powered by OpenGL 3.3**: it’s the default. That version of OpenGL is
//! old enough to support a wide range of devices out there. However, it’s possible that your device
//! is older or that you target the Web or Android / iOS. In that case, you should have a look at
//! the set of feature flags, which offers the possibility to compile [luminance] on several
//! platforms.
//!
//! ## Feature flags
//!
//!   - `default = ["std"]`
//!   - `std`: Compile against the standard library. If you disable that feature, you get a tinier
//!     executable but you’re responsible for lots of stuff. **Currently, that feature is not well
//!     tested and very experimental; use with care and caution and please provide feedback on
//!     the issue tracker if you try it out!**
//!
//! # Windowing
//!
//! [luminance] does not provide a way to create windows because it’s important that it not depend
//! on windowing libraries – so that end-users can use whatever they like. Furthermore, such
//! libraries typically implement windowing and events features, which have nothing to do with our
//! initial purpose.
//!
//! Nevertheless, an ecosystem effort exists towards [luminance]: [luminance-windowing]. That
//! crate provides a windowing API that is implemented by other crates, such as [luminance-glfw].
//! You don’t have to use them, though. If you’re interested into how you should setup windowing for
//! [luminance] to work, this very documentation explains it in the [`GraphicsContext`] section.
//!
//! # User-guide and contributor-guide
//!
//! If you just plan to use [luminance], just read the *User-guide* section.
//!
//! If you plan to contribute to [luminance] (by writing a windowing crate or hacking on [luminance]
//! directly), feel free to read the *Contributor-guide* section after having read the *User-guide*
//! section as well.
//!
//! ## User-guide
//!
//! ### Creating a context
//!
//! In order to get started, you need to create an object which type implements [`GraphicsContext`].
//! [luminance] ships with the trait but no implementor. You need to head over
//! [crates.io and search for luminance crates](https://crates.io/search?q=luminance) to find a
//! windowing backend first.
//!
//! Such a backend should expose a type which implements [`GraphicsContext`]. You can create one per
//! thread. That limitation enables [luminance] not to perform plenty of runtime branching,
//! minimizing the runtime overhead.
//!
//! > If you really want several contexts, you will need several OS threads.
//!
//! [`GraphicsContext`] is the entry-point of everything [luminance] provides. Feel free to dig in
//! its documentation for further information on how to use [luminance]. Most objects you can
//! create will need a mutable reference to such a context object. Even though [luminance] is
//! stateless in terms of global state, it still requires to have an object representing the GPU
//! somehow.
//!
//! ### Understanding the pipeline architecture
//!
//! [luminance] has a very particular way of doing graphics. It represents a typical _graphics
//! pipeline_ via a typed [AST] that is embedded into your code. As you might already know, when you
//! write code, you’re actually creating an [AST]: expressions, assignments, bindings, conditions,
//! function calls, etc. They all represent a typed tree that represents your program.
//!
//! [luminance] uses that property to create a dependency between resources your GPU needs to
//! have in order to perform a render. Typical engines, libraries and frameworks require you to
//! explicitly _bind_ something; instead, [luminance] requires you to go deeper in the [AST] by
//! creating a new lower node to mark the dependency.
//!
//! It might be weird at first but you’ll see how simple and easy it is. If you want to perform a
//! simple draw call of a triangle, you need several resources:
//!
//!   - A [`Tess`] that represents the triangle. It holds three vertices.
//!   - A shader [`Program`], for shading the triangle with a constant color, for short and simple.
//!   - A [`Framebuffer`], to accept and hold the actual render.
//!   - A [`RenderState`], to state how the render should be performed.
//!
//! There is a dependency _graph_ to represent how the resources must behave regarding each other:
//!
//! ```text
//! (AST1)
//!
//! Framebuffer ─> Shader ─> RenderState ─> Tess
//! ```
//!
//! The framebuffer must be _active_, _bound_, _used_ — or whatever verb you want to picture it
//! with — before the shader can start doing things. The shader must also be in use before we can
//! actually render the tessellation.
//!
//! That triple dependency relationship is already a small flat [AST]. Imagine we want to render
//! a second triangle with the same render state and a third triangle with a different render state:
//!
//! ```text
//! (AST2)
//!
//! Framebuffer ─> Shader ─> RenderState ─> Tess
//!                  │            │
//!                  │            └───────> Tess
//!                  │
//!                  └─────> RenderState ─> Tess
//! ```
//!
//! That [AST] looks more complex. Imagine now that we want to shade one other triangle with
//! another shader!
//!
//! ```text
//! (AST3)
//!
//! Framebuffer ─> Shader ─> RenderState ─> Tess
//!      │           │            │
//!      │           │            └───────> Tess
//!      │           │
//!      │           └─────> RenderState ─> Tess
//!      │
//!      └───────> Shader ─> RenderState ─> Tess
//! ```
//!
//! You can now clearly see the [AST]s and the relationships between objects. Those are encoded
//! in [luminance] within your code directly: lambdas / closures.
//!
//! > If you have followed thoroughly, you might have noticed that you cannot, with such [AST]s,
//! > shade a triangle with another shader but using the same render state as another node. That
//! > was a decision that was needed to be made: how should we allow the [AST] to be shared?
//! > In terms of graphics pipeline, [luminance] tries to do the best thing to minimize the number
//! > of GPU context switches and CPU <=> GPU bandwidth congestion.
//!
//! ### The lambda & closure design
//!
//! A function is a perfect candidate to modelize a dependency. When you look at:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn tronfibulate(x: Foo) -> Bar;
//! ```
//!
//! `tronfibulate` here is _covariant_ in `Bar` and _contravariant_ in `Foo`. What it implies is
//! that for the function itself, if we have a function that does `Zoo -> Foo`, then we can create
//! a new version of `tronfibulate` that will have, as input, a `Zoo`. Contravariance maps backwards
//! while covariance maps forwards (i.e. if you have `Bar -> Quux`, you can adapt `tronfibulate` to
//! create a new function that will output `Quux` value).
//!
//! All this to say that a dependency (which is contravariant) is pretty interesting in our case
//! since we will be able to adapt and create new functions just by contra-mapping the input. In
//! terms of combinational power, that is gold.
//!
//! Now, let’s try to represent `AST1` with contravariance and, hence, functions, using pseudo-code
//! (this is not real [luminance] excerpt).
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // AST1
//! use_framebuffer(framebuffer, || {
//!   // here, we are passing a closure that will get called whenever the framebuffer is ready to
//!   // receive renders
//!   use_shader(shader, || {
//!     // same thing but for shader
//!     use_render_state(render_state, || {
//!       // ditto for render state
//!       triangle.render(); // render the tessellation
//!     });
//!   );
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! See how simple it is to represent `AST1` with just code and closures? Rust’s lifetimes and
//! existential quantification allows us to ensure that no resource will leave the scope of each
//! closures, hence enforcing memory and coherency safety.
//!
//! Now let’s try to tackle `AST2`.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // AST2
//! use_framebuffer(framebuffer, || {
//!   use_shader(shader, || {
//!     use_render_state(render_state, || {
//!       first_triangle.render();
//!       second_triangle.render(); // simple and straight-forward
//!     });
//!
//!     // we can just branch a new render state here!
//!     use_render_state(other_render_state, || {
//!       third.render()
//!     });
//!   );
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! And `AST3`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // AST3
//! use_framebuffer(framebuffer, || {
//!   use_shader(shader, || {
//!     use_render_state(render_state, || {
//!       first_triangle.render();
//!       second_triangle.render(); // simple and straight-forward
//!     });
//!
//!     // we can just branch a new render state here!
//!     use_render_state(other_render_state, || {
//!       third.render()
//!     });
//!   );
//!
//!   use_shader(other_shader, || {
//!     use_render_state(yet_another_render_state, || {
//!       other_triangle.render();
//!     });
//!   });
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! The [luminance] equivalent is a bit more complex because it implies some objects that need
//! to be introduced first.
//!
//! ### [`Pipeline`]
//!
//! A [`Pipeline`] represents a whole [AST] as seen as just above. It is created by a
//! [`GraphicsContext`] when you ask to create a pipeline and is destroyed as soon as the render has
//! happened. A [`Pipeline`] is a special object you can use to bind some specific scarce resources,
//! such as _textures_ and _buffers_.
//!
//! Creating a [`Pipeline`] requires at least one resource: a [`Framebuffer`] to render to.
//!
//! When you create a pipeline, you’re also handed a [`ShadingGate`]. A [`ShadingGate`] is an object
//! that allows you to create _shader_ nodes in the [AST] you’re building. You have no other way
//! to go deeper in the [AST]. The concept of _gates_ is very important and you should try to
//! familiarize yourself with it.
//!
//! ### [`ShadingGate`]
//!
//! As said above, a [`ShadingGate`] allows you to create a _shader node_ in the graphics pipeline.
//! That node will typically borrow a shader [`Program`] and will move you one level lower in the
//! graph ([AST]). At that level (i.e. in that closure), you are given two objects:
//!
//!   - A [`RenderGate`], discussed below.
//!   - A [`ProgramInterface`], which is parametered by the type of uniform your shader [`Program`]
//!     defines.
//!
//! The [`ProgramInterface`] is the only way for you to access your _uniform interface_. More on
//! this in the dedicated section. It also provides you with the [`ProgramInterface::query`]
//! method, that allows you to perform _dynamic uniform lookup_.
//!
//! ### [`RenderGate`]
//!
//! A [`RenderGate`] is the second to last gate you will be handling. It allows you to create
//! _render state_ nodes in your [AST], creating a new level for you to render tessellations with
//! an obvious, final gate: the [`TessGate`].
//!
//! The kind of object that node manipulates is [`RenderState`].
//!
//! ### [`TessGate`]
//!
//! The [`TessGate`] is the final gate you use in an [AST]. It’s used to create _tessellation
//! nodes_. Those are used to render actual [`Tess`]. You cannot go any deeper in the [AST] at that
//! stage.
//!
//! [`TessGate`]s don’t immediately use [`Tess`] as inputs. They use [`TessSlice`]. That type is
//! a simple GPU slice into a GPU tessellation ([`Tess`]). It can be obtained from a [`Tess`] via
//! the [`TessSliceIndex`] trait.
//!
//! ## Contributor-guide
//!
//! You want to hack around [luminance] or provide a windowing crate? Everything you have to know is
//! described in this section.
//!
//! ### What it means to be a luminance windowing backend
//!
//! [luminance] doesn’t know anything about the context it executes in. That means that it doesn’t
//! know whether it’s used within the SDL, GLFW, glutin, Qt or an embedded specific hardware such
//! as the Nintendo Switch. That is actually powerful, because it allows [luminance] to be
//! completely agnostic of the execution platform it’s running on: one problem less.
//!
//! However, the connection between [luminance] and the execution context must be correctly done.
//! Currently, several points must be enforced:
//!
//!   - The _OpenGL version_ must be **3.3**.
//!   - The _OpenGL profile_ must be **core**.
//!   - OpenGL _forward compatibility_ must be enabled.
//!
//! Those rules might change and be adapted regarding the _feature flags_ that are enabled. For
//! instance, if you use a feature flag that allows to use _OpenGL 2.1_, then you should use a
//! **2.1** _OpenGL version_.
//!
//! ### [`GraphicsContext`], [`GraphicsState`] and TLS
//!
//! In order to implement [`GraphicsContext`], you need to know several points:
//!
//!   - You can get a [`GraphicsState`] with the [`GraphicsState::new`] function. You **have** to match the return
//!     value. Depending on whether your implementation is the first asking a [`GraphicsState`] on the current
//!     thread, you might get (or not) an `Ok(state)`. If not, a descriptive error is returned.
//!   - You’re advised to `map` and `map_err` over the [`GraphicsState::new`] returned value to implement your
//!     own `new` function for your backend type because of the restriction of having only one context per
//!     thread in [luminance].
